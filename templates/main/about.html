          <p class="ui segment">The building of the Quezon Science High School, which was constructed during Quezon Governor Rafael Nantes' administration, was originally intended to be a science museum but according to Governor David Suarez such plans were dropped due to fiercer competition from other museums based in Metro Manila. In 2010, Gloria Potes, Division of Quezon's then School Division Superintendent, made a suggestion to Suarez to convert the building to a science high school. The building was also planned to be converted to a call center facility but the plan likewise didn't push through due to lack of local manpower. The proposal was accepted since Quezon was the only province in the CALABARZON region not to have a science high school at that time. The school was inaugurated in August 17, 2011. QSHS held its first commencement ceremony last March 2015, having 71 students graduating.</p>
